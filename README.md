		<h1> Hello World </h1>
		<h2> A place I would go like to visit </h2>
			<p> If I had to visit anywhere in the world I would like to visit Europe 
			or Greece. I would choose either of these locations because I think it is so 
			beautiful just seeing picture of these places, I can only imagine how much 
			more beautiful it would be in person, also because it would be nice going
			somewhere out of the U.S </p>
			
		<h2> A person I admire(past or present) </h2>
			<p> One person I admire would be my mother, her name is Cherlyn, I admire her
			so much because she is such a strong hard working person, she helps 
			others even when she is going through her own struggles and continues to 
			press on forward no matter where she is at in life. </p>
